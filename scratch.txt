Hello World! I am a aspiring web developer seeking to become fluent with all material required for full-stack development. I was born in South Carolina, and from a young age I became fasicnated with drawing, along with detail orientation and reasoning that runs in my family,  I believe this is why I gravitated towards visual design and program functionality. I am happily married with a wife who also may become a web developer. Thankful to share this moment with you.
